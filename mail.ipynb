I recommend using a framework like Ikigai, a Japanese concept that means \"a reason for being.\"\\n\\nThis framework can help you find the sweet spot between:\\n\\n- What you love\\n- What you\\'re good at\\n- What the world needs\\n- What you can be paid for\\n\\nExploring these different Ikigai petals can help you gain clarity on your ideal career path, which will not only utilize your skills but also bring you fulfillment and purpose.\\n\\nLast thing Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 when you\\'re ready to take on your interviews, be sure to check out our AI Mock Interview (https://learn.educative.io/e3t/Ctc/RG+113/cz5H404/VX3FLv5D-3t4W8c15j_1nshfKW8yJSQm5hsfLyN1PJbvl3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3pCW4K6dzl65N6WqW6n4cTM4J34ZNW5Wy5Xm7yT3p1W8VP46-8spJLFW3pJqWX8sk1DXW1bhwYj77gW0VW9d0V9h1v_ClHW7-551S8R9gGjW5FGRNB7CpsS2W8M-Hf131g6TWW4v5ZT57McGQ1W8cgn3r7bD5DJW7n4D7W31Rd6VVWYl9Y3r7cYWN6TW8hPrspVgW7J0fF275V4RVW7yS66c1fYbP_N2kN2l_rhwnBW3MGbSs83M4_vVdJnw47Lb_5pN8Mx08DP1f5YW1_4QnY2ktZPSW8qrlR65n00fjW7JT2hW7QpvvvW8g4ZcM72Cm71N30cbTm1Rz1LW43wTVY5_ZJVSW4CgJQd4xGHY7f2WS7hF04 ) tool that we previously launched this year.\\n\\nIf you sign up today, you can get 40% off our Premium and Premium Plus learning plans, which includes AI Mock Interviews!\\n\\nLock In 40% Off\\n(https://learn.educative.io/e3t/Ctc/RG+113/cz5H404/VX3FLv5D-3t4W8c15j_1nshfKW8yJSQm5hsfLyN1PJbvl3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3pkW7v2mjX7YrZycVf808R6clWrKW5SRqWH5ZTrMTW6y6vNZ2CTgm7W5HXhcB31V2dJW89cxjj8nX1VcN3tbj09BrWbQV3J44N5k7LYzW6rZs976H6RFVW3L42Qs8gn6tpMFLYmRwLBM8W23kls05fVc0FW7KQKn_3jx3MfW7DrCP85dF7dfW5DQX0g7w0yrhW4FsSLr5KWl2HW6PpZzD7LH951W3hFyyK28DZ2VV5PS0c8TS4-6W4tPxs61K47XHW3dWWmN8XgfWzVN6X6X65m60mW1F4X233QQFSjW4C3Mqg5MqljGW2xdZ6c2PBJdvW4BHwtm920_K5W5XGjS229XTwNN2FVztfPs5Tnf3m38nj04 )\\n\\nUntil then, happy learning!\\n\\nFahim ul Haq\\n\\nCEO & Cofounder\\n\\neducative.io (https://learn.educative.io/e3t/Ctc/RG+113/cz5H404/VX3FLv5D-3t4W8c15j_1nshfKW8yJSQm5hsfLyN1PJbts3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3m6N23zjKg67KnfW7YRXsJ1jTkmjW4l8FWw7vPWG7Vd68NQ5WQT9XW5MzRjk52qMt4W7fqpq240TnpWW7tjZn58WYR3VW477qPQ5HkrnnW1W7qmk5x22g_VGRjRq4rW4kcW29yC457phR4PN3yzjn0WM32PW7H4C1X4dtgYbW3MDXKg6CGFkmW5q2xxM2D1_hxW1bSRmz7XBK-lN81gtqMrPndBW456KfV8NwgdYW5Lbwcy5jJxnyW7CQfpY2Zp8mnW7pg3Zl93_CvpW2qMmCy46V4R0f325V4n04 )\\n\\nEducative, 12280 NE District Way, Bellevue, WA 98005 United States\\n\\nEmail Preferences (https://learn.educative.io/hs/email-subscriptions/preferences/en/manage?data=W2nXS-N30h-SvW3JZzzd3VxRXWW3brK772WtpK8W2TKWc83R1Zd2W3GWQ8H1LDGTwW45z8Mr1_pVXmW2y26FJ3ZG5TQW3VP9qR1BnnnfW25jG4W4rB82fW2PCbrp2FM2CxW34mgY8367WbXW3VxSF43gm-stW1Bxd8t49RGvxW3JXwwy3jtd03W1VhPb-2p7--YW21pc_k32p7FNW2zWVg34pkFNwW2YNLLy2RDFRwW3zcdcR1LdY8RW1S8wrg3Cf7_qW32pbbT3H4rvnW2WFY8L3QCcs7W3GV9Kv49gmGKW32zkw43ggCcgW2RCQy32CtmSXW41RcWV1_nZZNW4kqGm43F4BXtW3zg7_-3_wpn1W3GYYkM2RRX31W1NpVfZ1NcPsbW1W_Mn83_zPvQW43nKwp1_djWZW2zHkSK3CdKFPW1NfxX43GHLXDW25q5yx1BnK68W2vz-8k3by_KNW36FtwG1_bC-_W1_jtWT2qQVqKW1Zblx23HcY7fW4pDy0k34mj4rW2RkWk73CjsFcW3BQqdd1VcfrNW4cjBRw3d2kvZW3JZ7Fm47BC58W4fgJnp43nLGrW3gcGcZ3BJz-hf2sTtVN04&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_MxFchL30Q4XRhdkcpVoS62hh5YXORcJ441b7OeoCv_v3eEoKNb80x8YuLLw7qISyamFyrMOz1RMv3XXuoyq3x1sB7Sg&_hsmi=315564100 )',\n",

Parametrize your training script\\nTo train a good ML model you typically need to re-run your training script 100s (if no 1000s of time) each time possibly changing something (like an input, or a small code change).\\nBecause of this, I strongly recommend you encapsulate your training logic into a function with clearly defined inputs, that makes your workflow transparent and fully reproducible.\\nFor example, our training function has the following signature:\\ndef train(\\n    feature_view_name: str,\\n    feature_view_version: int,\\n    ohlc_window_sec: int,\\n    product_id: str,\\n    last_n_days_to_fetch_from_store: int,\\n    last_n_days_to_test_model: int,\\n    prediction_window_sec: int,\\n):\\nInternally, this function follows 6 steps:\\nFetch training data from the Feature Store.\\n# Step 1    \\n# Fetch the data from the feature store\\nohlc_data_reader = OhlcDataReader(\\n    ohlc_window_sec=ohlc_window_sec,\\n    feature_view_name=feature_view_name,\\n    feature_view_version=feature_view_version,\\n)\\nlogger.info('Fetching OHLC data from the feature store')\\nohlc_data = ohlc_data_reader.read_from_offline_store(\\n    product_id=product_id,\\n    last_n_days=last_n_days_to_fetch_from_store,\\n)\\nSplit the data into training and test sets\\n# Step 2\\n# Split the data into training and testing using a cutoff date\\n\\nlogger.info('Splitting the data into training and testing')\\nohlc_train, ohlc_test = split_train_test(\\n    ohlc_data=ohlc_data,\\n    last_n_days_to_test_model=last_n_days_to_test_model,\\n)\\nPre-process the data for each split, in this case missing value interpolation for time-series:\\n# Step 3\\n# Preprocess the data for training and for testing\\n# Interpolate missing candles\\n\\nlogger.info('Interpolating missing candles for training data')\\nohlc_train = interpolate_missing_candles(\\n  ohlc_train, ohlc_window_sec)\\n\\nlogger.info('Interpolating missing candles for testing data')\\nohlc_test = interpolate_missing_candles(\\n  ohlc_test, ohlc_window_sec)\\nGenerate the target metric to predict (if your target metric is already present you can skip this)\\n# Step 4\\n# Create the target metric as a new column\\n# in our dataframe for training and testing\\n\\nlogger.info('Creating the target metric for training data')\\nohlc_train = create_target_metric(\\n    ohlc_train,\\n    ohlc_window_sec,\\n    prediction_window_sec,\\n)\\nlogger.info('Creating the target metric for test data')\\nohlc_test = create_target_metric(\\n    ohlc_test,\\n    ohlc_window_sec,\\n    prediction_window_sec,\\n)\\nBuild a simple baseline model, and\\n# Step 5\\n# Let's build a baseline model\\nmodel = BaselineModel(\\n    n_candles_into_future=prediction_window_sec // ohlc_window_sec,\\n)\\n\\ny_test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)\\nbaseline_test_mae = evaluate_model(\\n    predictions=y_test_predictions,\\n    actuals=y_test,\\n    description='Baseline model on Test data',\\n)\\nTrain an ML model, possibly doing some feature engineering to provide stronger signals, and hyper-parameter tuning, to squeeze as much signal as possible.\\n# Step 6\\n# Build a more complex model\\nX_train = add_features(\\n    X_train,\\n    n_candles_into_future=prediction_window_sec // ohlc_window_sec,\\n)\\nX_test = add_features(\\n    X_test,\\n    n_candles_into_future=prediction_window_sec // ohlc_window_sec,\\n)\\n\\nfrom src.model_factory import fit_lasso_regressor \\nmodel = fit_lasso_regressor(\\n    X_train,\\n    y_train,\\n    tune_hyper_params=False,\\n)\\ntest_mae = evaluate_model(\\n    predictions=model.predict(X_test),\\n    actuals=y_test,\\n    description='Lasso regression model on Test data',\\n)\\nSave the model to disk\\n# Step 7\\n# Save the model as pickle file\\nimport pickle\\nwith open('./lasso_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:\\n    logger.debug('Saving the model as a pickle file')\\n    pickle.dump(model, f)\\nOnce you have your basic training script logic ready, you integrate it with your ML platform.\\nStep 2.

Log parameters, metrics and charts\\nEvery training run corresponds to an experiment, that you create at the beginning of your training script\\n# Create an experiment to log metadata to CometML\\nfrom comet_ml import Experiment\\nexperiment = Experiment(\\n    api_key=os.environ['COMET_ML_API_KEY'],\\n    project_name=os.environ['COMET_ML_PROJECT_NAME'],\\n    workspace=os.environ['COMET_ML_WORKSPACE'],\\n)\\nInside this experiment we will log every parameter, metric or chart that can help us\\nunderstand if the training run worked as expected (or not), and\\neasy the deployment later one. This is very important.\\nFor example, in our case we log\\nThe input parameters to our training script\\nexperiment.log_parameters({\\n    'feature_view_name': feature_view_name,\\n    'feature_view_version': feature_view_version,\\n    'ohlc_window_sec': ohlc_window_sec,\\n    'product_id': product_id,\\n    'last_n_days_to_fetch_from_store': last_n_days_to_fetch_from_store,\\n    'last_n_days_to_test_model': last_n_days_to_test_model,\\n    'prediction_window_sec': prediction_window_sec,\\n})\\nA hash of the dataset we fetched from the Feature Store, to add data traceability\\nexperiment.log_dataset_hash(ohlc_data)\\nA plot of the target metric distribution\\noutput_file = './target_metric_histogram.png'\\nplot_target_metric_histogram(\\n  ohlc_train['target'], output_file, n_bins=100)\\nexperiment.log_image(output_file, 'target_metric_histogram')\\nThe baseline error metric\\nexperiment.log_metric('baseline_model_mae_test', baseline_test_mae)\\nThe ML model error metric\\nexperiment.log_metric('lasso_model_mae_test', test_mae)\\nThe model artifact\\nmodel_name = get_model_name(product_id)\\nexperiment.log_model(\\n  name=model_name,\\n  file_or_folder='./lasso_model.pkl'\\n)\\nStep 4. Validate the model and push it to the registry\\nFinally, at the end of your training script you need to see if the model you just trained is Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cgood enoughÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d to be considered for deployment.\\nWhat does good enough mean?\\nThis depends on the problem you work on. In our case, we built a price change predictor for the crypto market, which is a very hard problem. Hence, a model that can beat our simple baseline model is already good enough, so we register it.\\nSo, in our case, the training script concludes with:\\nif test_mae < baseline_test_mae:\\n  experiment.register_model(\\n      model_name=model_name,\\n  )\\n[IMAGE MODEL REGISTRY]\\nStep 5.

These regular updates are typically written in an informal style or as a series of articles/tutorials documenting or explaining something.\\nBlogs became popular in the early 2000s as part of the move to Web 2.0 - when websites began to move from passive documents to participatory user-generated content.\\nIf You Enjoy Coding Challenges Here Are Three Ways You Can Help Support It\\nRefer a friend or colleague to the newsletter.

Fundamentally a blog should provide you with some way to write and edit the blog posts, the software to render them as HTML using a layout youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99ve designed, and a way for readers to comment on your posts.\\nStep Zero\\nIn this step you decide which programming language and IDE youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re going to use and you get yourself setup with a nice new project ready to build your blogging software.\\nStep 1\\nIn this step your goal is to serve a static web page. You want to be able to run your blog software and have it serve traffic on your developer machine. For me that means IÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99ll simply run it on port 8080 and visit it with a browser:\\nOr curl:\\n% curl -i <http://localhost:8080/>\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\n\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\n  <head>\\n    <title>My Blog</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>\\n    <p>The first blog post I\\'ve written on my blogging software!</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n\\nOnce youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99ve done this you are able to serve HTML from your blogging platform.\\nStep 2\\nIn this step your goal is to render some content in a template. Ultimately once we have a full blogging platform itÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s main job is to read articles from some form of datastore and render them as HTML using a common layout. That layout is usually defined with a template. For this step letÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s turn our index page into a template and render some content in it.\\nHereÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s what the template might look like:\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\n  <head>\\n    <title>My Blog</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n   {{postlist}}\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n\\nWhich we could then fill in from some sample data we might have retrieved from our datastore, i.e. we might get some JSON:\\n{\\n    \"posts\": [\\n        {\\n            \"title\": \"My First Blog Post\",\\n            \"summary\": \"The first blog post I\\'ve written on my blogging software!\",\\n            \"post\": \"This is my first blog post content...\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n\\nWhen you then visit the blog as before you should see the same result that we saw in step 1.\\nStep 3\\nIn this step your goal is to be able to write the content of a blog post on a web page. To do this youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99ll need to do several things:\\nCreate an admin section for the blog. IÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99d suggest you make that available via a URL like: /editor. When you visit this section you should be authenticated, or if you are not authenticated directed to a login page.\\nCreate a page to create a new blog post (perhaps /editor/post). On this page allow the user to enter a post title, summary and the post itself. To allow for formatting I suggest you encourage the user to write the post using Markdown.\\nWhen the user hits Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x98postÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99 or Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x98saveÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99 (whatever you decide to call it) the content should be saved as a new post. For now, IÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99d suggest simply writing the Markdown to a file, perhaps using the JSON format above.\\nRender the post at a suitable URL using a template. For example it might be at /posts/1.\\nStep 4\\nIn this step your goal is to support editing the content of a blog post. The user should be able to login, select a post from a list and then edit the post, updating the fields in the post.\\nAt this stage you should also add a published date and time to the post, which getÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s set when the post is created and can optionally be updated when editing.\\nStep 5\\nIn this step your goal is to store the content of the posts in a database rather than as a text based file. You could do this with a SQL or NoSQL database. Your task here is to consider the tradeoffs and then update the existing code to use your chosen option to save and read all the posts.\\nStep 6\\nIn this step your goal is to render a homepage listing the blog posts from the database. The posts should be ordered from newest to oldest. Each title should be a link to the full blog post.\\nStep 7\\nIn this step your goal is to allow comments on blog posts. A user should be able to enter their name, email and comment in response to a blog post.\\nYou should render the comments under a post in order of newest to oldest.\\nGoing Further\\nYou can take this coding challenge further by adding:\\nSupport for RSS feeds\\nThe ability to edit the template through the /editor section of the blog.\\nThe ability to schedule a post.\\n2 Other Ways I Can Help You:\\nI write another FREE newsletterÃ\\x82Â\\xa0Developing Skills [ https://substack.com/redirect/58103968-3d56-40fa-8366-42ccaf63007b?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]Ã\\x82Â\\xa0that helps you level up the other skills you need to be a great software developer.\\nI have some courses available:\\nBuild Your Own Redis Server (Python Edition) [ https://substack.com/redirect/630c811e-f29a-4507-b4b1-11bd64c00394?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ] which guides you through solving the Redis Coding Challenge in Python.\\nBuild Your Own Shell (Go Edition) [ https://substack.com/redirect/f956e4e5-3d3d-4cee-8951-38499024145b?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ] which guides you through solving the Shell Coding Challenge in Go.\\nShare Your Solutions!\\nIf you think your solution is an example other developers can learn from please share it, put it on GitHub, GitLab or elsewhere.

Despite controversies, the Kano Model remains extremely popular:\\nSo, in todayÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s newsletter:\\nWhat is the Kano Model?\\nHow do People Use the Kano Model?\\nKano Model: Pros and Cons\\nÃ°Â\\x9fÂ\\x94Â\\x92 How to Combine the Kano Model with Modern Product Discovery?\\nÃ°Â\\x9fÂ\\x94Â\\x92 Conclusions and Key Takeaways\\n1. What is the Kano Model?\\nThe Kano Model, developed by Professor Noriaki Kano in the 1980s, is a theory of customer preferences. It identifies 5 types of features and explains how to prioritize them to maximize customer satisfaction:\\nThe three main categories are:\\nMust-haves (aka Must-be): These features are fundamental. If present, they do not increase customer satisfaction, but when absent, they can cause significant frustration. For example:\\nThe steering wheel in a car.\\nThe ability to reset your password in a web app.\\nPerformance: The more functionality you provide, the happier your customers are. Conversely, less functionality leads to more complaints. For example:\\nThe fuel tank capacity in a car.\\nThe time it takes to display search results in a web app.\\nDelighters (aka Attractive): Customers donÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t expect those features. When present, they are a pleasant surprise. The more functionality customers get, the better. For example:\\nA free Coca-Cola on a plane when you donÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t expect it.\\nA micro-interaction in the user interface.\\nThe last two categories are often skipped as not helpful [ https://substack.com/redirect/9cc57dd0-30e4-463f-a41f-797ed9102b84?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]:\\nIndifferent: These features do not impact customer satisfaction, whether present or not. An example can be the ability to choose different cursor icons hidden in the app settings. \\nReverse: Less functionality makes customers happier, while more functionality leads to dissatisfaction. An example can be an automatic video playback that frustrates the users.\\nImportantly, in the Kano Model, customer satisfaction refers to an emotional response to a feature's presence or absence. This is not the same as satisfaction from the Opportunity Scores [ https://substack.com/redirect/10dd1cd8-6a88-4336-a43c-1b2ceca50fd9?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ] in which satisfaction means how well the need is met.\\nLetÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s modify the diagram to clarify we talk about the emotional response:\\n2. How do People Use the Kano Model?\\nTo categorize your features, you need to perform a survey in which customers are typically asked two questions:\\nWhen using [product], how would you feel if it had that feature?\\nWhen using [product], how would you feelÃ\\x82Â\\xa0if it didnÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t have that feature?\\nWith five possible answers:\\nYou can then easily interpret the results using the following table:\\nHere [ https://substack.com/redirect/c37ce7f4-aba7-4af6-b144-485a062faae4?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ], you can find detailed instructions and download a spreadsheet (no email) that runs formulas for you and two table variants. Repeating those considerations was not the goal of this post.\\n3. Kano Model: Pros and Cons\\nWhat I love about the Kano Model is that it focuses on the customers' feelings and emotional responses.\\nAt the same time, the model is often criticized for poor survey response options, lack of adjustment to tech products, and high human bias.\\nA few quotes:\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cThe classification of performance features is indeed a weaker theoretical spot of the Kano model.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d - Conjointly [ https://substack.com/redirect/55aabb97-2fd8-4d1a-990d-1b06b8d6a5a2?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9c(Ã¢Â\\x80Â¦) for tech product performance enhancement is attracting and surprising, and also performant, and also a must-haveÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d - Quant UX Blog [ https://substack.com/redirect/e471ac2f-7bdc-474b-8da3-65e37cedbd1a?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9c(Ã¢Â\\x80Â¦) traditional Kano model is a human intensive activity thus promotes the passionate and biased behavior of human.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d - An integrated approach of Kano's model [ https://substack.com/redirect/2b793a8d-269a-46f0-b8db-8f2fde3052e1?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9c(Ã¢Â\\x80Â¦) traditional Kano model with a range of answers are insufficient to reflect the multifaceted thoughts of an individualÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d - An integrated approach of Kano's model [ https://substack.com/redirect/2b793a8d-269a-46f0-b8db-8f2fde3052e1?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]\\nLastly, my biggestÃ\\x82Â\\xa0concern is:\\nThe Kano Model focuses onÃ\\x82Â\\xa0features, not customer needs.\\nThis is dangerous, as this often results in little to no effort to understand the customer's needs. As a result, the features we build do not solve customer problems. And nobody uses them.\\nThis common problem is often visualized as the Product Death Cycle Trap [ https://substack.com/redirect/ebb134f2-07ff-4eb6-a7d8-13f5c702d67c?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]:\\nI love this quote I saw for the first time in Jobs-to-be-Done [ https://substack.com/redirect/dc047be8-3d30-45e8-ab48-fbb1f02cbb12?j=eyJ1IjoiMmxxMnd2In0.DmDO3CeKAJKeNkHrJG8b4vNsAQ89u18vNFgHE6_X-Uk ]:\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cPeople donÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d - Theodore Levitt\\nSo, is there a way to leverage the benefits of Professor KanoÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s thinking without becoming yet another feature factory?\\nI believe there is a simple way to extract what's best.\\n3.

With just a few clicks, deploy\\neither app directly from your database\\'s page in the Render Dashboard.\\n\\nEach app is deployed to a new Render web service that automatically\\nconnects to your database (no configuration required).\\n\\nLearn more in the docs: https://docs.render.com/postgresql-apps\\n\\n# Build advanced automations with over 50 new API endpoints\\n\\nWe just added tons of new capabilities to the Render API so that you\\ncan build much more sophisticated integrations with the platform:\\n\\n- Create a PostgreSQL database, trigger a backup, and even fail over\\n  to your high availability standby.\\n- Attach a persistent disk to your service, increase its size, and\\n  restore it to a past snapshot.\\n- Fetch your service logs and subscribe to real-time updates over\\n  WebSocket.\\n\\nPlus, there are new endpoints for managing Redis, Blueprints,\\nproject environments, and service metrics.\\n\\nOpen the API reference to explore what\\'s possible and start integrating:\\nhttps://api-docs.render.com/reference/introduction\\n\\n# Export comprehensive audit logs for your organization\\n\\nTo meet your organization\\'s compliance requirements, admins can now\\nexport audit logs of material actions performed by team members over a\\ngiven period. Know exactly when a service was created, deleted, or\\naccessed over SSH, and by which team members.\\n\\nAudit logs require an Organization or Enterprise plan. For details,\\nsee the documentation: https://docs.render.com/audit-logs\\n\\n# Add Render to your Terraform configuration\\n\\nFor teams using Terraform to orchestrate architecture across multiple\\nclouds, we\\'ve published an official, open-source Terraform provider\\nfor managing Render services alongside your other systems:\\nhttps://registry.terraform.io/providers/render-oss/render\\n\\nThe provider\\'s in early access for the time being (we\\'ll let you know\\nwhen it graduates), so please report any issues you find:\\nhttps://github.com/render-oss/terraform-provider-render/issues\\n\\nAnd if you\\'re looking for a Render-specific infrastructure-as-code model,\\nBlueprints are just the ticket:\\nhttps://docs.render.com/infrastructure-as-code\\n\\n--\\n\\nWe\\'ve got lots more in store over the next few weeks. Thoughts or\\nfeedback in the meantime? Should \"admintegration\" be added to the\\ndictionary? Let us know at community.render.com or by replying to\\nthis email.\\n\\n\\nHave a great weekend,\\n\\nStephen Barlow\\nDeveloper Content at Render\\nUnsubscribe: https://subscriptions.pstmrk.it/unsubscribe?m=1.GczrM1uhI5WnSAYXfDreVQ.7rXmn5ha60UfJ7QJA9Oup1-_cksDA20mM6kzqmQIyASsC2ZjvpuOVD6sycNwtwRqFeo02wIpc6nu1ngWW8esSdi0JBNuID9Va0hlcbRdO5m8yKlpey_tpCslZmkQJ7MHfsrkxHm2LtemphBw_7ZajBiEx6_lv8YttEZAvfxBRA9dmFvOIJbpjiq9jXHIVh_byFbh_M3cAb243xwI_IM2PyOAbyvtpYODNXIgtVxhBPclK02nnazMYae_g_c-jzOaSNYVN7Webor34u6ul47yw1JBm0uN_b670wPqbUe062dQgsAYV2_qx-9fhdH0jwMNZRdl0EQronlJART6nb3S_tO-QpP1V5aIBdP94_hYOw-BFjr8OJa3aT5S-imgW9X4Trj4ArONbnCjTXqjTdhNU6dThY0gLZ4VjZkThkbCJkXVLp40HBGbHpnM_8p2yXe9HzSchkrCQM6uT_-EU5mmX6FBR8u5xqtHS3eQIiaB1wpI2Fe7SQfEChB5hY3KyLNOaDvOto4R6kvCtXxDxLkeP_8odo2ySqvdpK8hseaQeWDuqZzkBQl7SEVtNzgQ8YYh',\n",
